# Encryption

## The First Rule of Security

Never write your own encryption algorithm.

If you feel like you have to write your own encryption algorithm, you're probably doing it wrong. Many many many smart people have spent their lives creating strong encryption protocols, which rely heavily on mathematics to ensure security.

## Plaintext vs Ciphertext

Time for some vocab 101.

__plaintext__: this is the note, message, data that you want to encrypt. If you want to send a note to a friend, the note is in plaintext.

__ciphertext__: the encrypted plaintext

## Encryption Protocols vs Hashing Protocols

Encryption Protocols are two-way or bidirectional. I can encrypt my plaintext and know that someone else can decrypt it to get the original plaintext back again.

Hashing Protocols only go one way. When you hash something, you can't get the plaintext back out. Commonly, hashing algorithms are used to ensure data integrity as it uses each bit of the plaintext to create some kind of string.

Let's try hashing the word "password".

    $ echo password | shasum -a 256
    6b3a55e0261b0304143f805a24924d0c1c44524821305f31d9277843b8a10f4e

I can run this over and over and get the same result. This works for any kind of file. If the bits match you'll always get the same result. But watch what happens when I change one of the characters.

    $ echo Password | shasum -a 256
    63726723570b39f1bee06f92a3680b689c23c038241c1fe3fe9665ba0b0949af

Note both of these start with a 6. That's purely coincidence. I could change any character in the input plaintext and get a completely different result.

    echo p4ssword | shasum -a 256
    6d5494c72325d57826dddd757c6e53bdde3f7eb03e6d796fbd7adac14afb10a8


You've probably seen checksums on the net when you download large files. Once downloaded to your machine, if you run the correct hashing algorithm against the download it should matchup with what you saw on the download site. If it doesn't match up then your file could have been damaged during download, or maybe someone replaced the ownload with something else, maybe more malicious.

## Common Protocols

### RSA

### DES

### AES

### Blowfish

### bcrypt
